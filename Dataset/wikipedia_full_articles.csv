Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,"Artificial intelligence(AI) is the capability ofcomputational systemsto perform tasks typically associated withhuman intelligence, such aslearning,reasoning,problem-solving,perception, anddecision-making. It is afield of researchincomputer sciencethat develops and studies methods andsoftwarethat enable machines toperceive their environmentand uselearningandintelligenceto take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1]
High-profileapplications of AIinclude advancedweb search engines(e.g.,Google Search);recommendation systems(used byYouTube,Amazon, andNetflix);virtual assistants(e.g.,Google Assistant,Siri, andAlexa);autonomous vehicles(e.g.,Waymo);generativeandcreativetools (e.g.,language modelsandAI art); andsuperhumanplay and analysis instrategy games(e.g.,chessandGo). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: ""A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it'snot labeled AI anymore.""[2][3]
Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning,reasoning,knowledge representation,planning,natural language processing,perception, and support forrobotics.[a]To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, includingsearchandmathematical optimization,formal logic,artificial neural networks, and methods based onstatistics,operations research, andeconomics.[b]AI also draws uponpsychology,linguistics,philosophy,neuroscience, and other fields.[4]Some companies, such asOpenAI,Google DeepMindandMeta,[5]aim to createartificial general intelligence(AGI)â€”AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6]and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughoutits history,[7][8]followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known asAI winters.[9][10]Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 whengraphics processing unitsstarted being used to accelerate neural networks anddeep learningoutperformed previous AI techniques.[11]This growth accelerated further after 2017 with thetransformer architecture.[12]In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapidprogressin advanced generative AI became known as theAI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raisedethical concernsaboutAI's long-term effectsandpotential existential risks, prompting discussions aboutregulatory policiesto ensurethe safetyand benefits of the technology."
Machine learning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,
Deep learning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning,"Inmachine learning,deep learningfocuses on utilizing multilayeredneural networksto perform tasks such asclassification,regression, andrepresentation learning. The field takes inspiration frombiological neuroscienceand is centered around stackingartificial neuronsinto layers and ""training"" them to process data. The adjective ""deep"" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can besupervised,semi-supervisedorunsupervised.[2]
Some common deep learning network architectures includefully connected networks,deep belief networks,recurrent neural networks,convolutional neural networks,generative adversarial networks,transformers, andneural radiance fields. These architectures have been applied to fields includingcomputer vision,speech recognition,natural language processing,machine translation,bioinformatics,drug design,medical image analysis,climate science, material inspection andboard gameprograms, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.[3][4][5]
Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes inbiological systems, particularly thehuman brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.[6]
Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layeredneural networkssuch asconvolutional neural networksandtransformers, although they can also includepropositional formulasor latent variables organized layer-wise in deepgenerative modelssuch as the nodes indeep belief networksand deepBoltzmann machines.[7]
Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class ofmachine learningalgorithmsin which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in animage recognitionmodel, the raw input may be animage(represented as atensorofpixels). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.
Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which levelon its own. Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-craftedfeature engineeringto transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the modeldiscoversuseful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.[8][2]
The word ""deep"" in ""deep learning"" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantialcredit assignment path(CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For afeedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). Forrecurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.[9]No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.[10]Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.
Deep learning architectures can be constructed with agreedylayer-by-layer method.[11]Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.[8]
Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner aredeep belief networks.[8][12]
The termdeep learningwas introduced to the machine learning community byRina Dechterin 1986,[13]and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context ofBooleanthreshold neurons.[14][15]Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated.[16]
Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of theuniversal approximation theorem[17][18][19][20][21]orprobabilistic inference.[22][23][8][9][24]
The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity offeedforward neural networkswith a single hidden layer of finite size to approximatecontinuous functions.[17][18][19][20]In 1989, the first proof was published byGeorge Cybenkoforsigmoidactivation functions[17]and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.[18]Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such asKunihiko Fukushima'srectified linear unit.[25][26]
The universal approximation theorem fordeep neural networksconcerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al.[21]proved that if the width of a deep neural network withReLUactivation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate anyLebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.
Theprobabilisticinterpretation[24]derives from the field ofmachine learning. It features inference,[23][7][8][9][12][24]as well as theoptimizationconcepts oftrainingandtesting, related to fitting andgeneralization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as acumulative distribution function.[24]The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction ofdropoutasregularizerin neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers includingHopfield,WidrowandNarendraand popularized in surveys such as the one byBishop.[27]
There are twotypesof artificial neural network (ANN):feedforward neural network(FNN) ormultilayer perceptron(MLP) andrecurrent neural networks(RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s,Wilhelm LenzandErnst Isingcreated theIsing model[28][29]which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972,Shun'ichi Amarimade this architecture adaptive.[30][31]His learning RNN was republished byJohn Hopfieldin 1982.[32]Other earlyrecurrent neural networkswere published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971.[33][34]Already in 1948,Alan Turingproduced work on ""Intelligent Machinery""  that was not published in his lifetime,[35]containing ""ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs"".[31]
Frank Rosenblatt(1958)[36]proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons ""with adaptive preterminal networks"" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight).[37]:â€Šsection 16The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960)[38]""functionally equivalent to a variation of"" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptivemultilayer perceptronswith learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion.
The first working deep learning algorithm was theGroup method of data handling, a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published byAlexey Ivakhnenkoand Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression,[39]or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships.[40]A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method,[41]which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or ""gates"".[31]
The first deep learningmultilayer perceptrontrained bystochastic gradient descent[42]was published in 1967 byShun'ichi Amari.[43]In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learnedinternal representationsto classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.[31]Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-endstochastic gradient descentthe currently dominant training technique.
In 1969,Kunihiko Fukushimaintroduced theReLU(rectified linear unit)activation function.[25][31]The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning.[44]
Deep learning architectures forconvolutional neural networks(CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with theNeocognitronintroduced byKunihiko Fukushimain 1979, though not trained by backpropagation.[45][46]
Backpropagationis an efficient application of thechain rulederived byGottfried Wilhelm Leibnizin 1673[47]to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology ""back-propagating errors"" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt,[37]but he did not know how to implement this, althoughHenry J. Kelleyhad a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context ofcontrol theory.[48]The modern form of backpropagation was first published inSeppo Linnainmaa's master thesis (1970).[49][50][31]G.M. Ostrovski et al. republished it in 1971.[51][52]Paul Werbosapplied backpropagation to neural networks in 1982[53](his 1974 PhD thesis, reprinted in a 1994 book,[54]did not yet describe the algorithm[52]). In 1986,David E. Rumelhartet al. popularised backpropagation but did not cite the original work.[55][56]
Thetime delay neural network(TDNN) was introduced in 1987 byAlex Waibelto apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation.[57][58]In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition.[59]In 1989,Yann LeCunet al. created a CNN calledLeNetforrecognizing handwritten ZIP codeson mail. Training required 3 days.[60]In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN onoptical computinghardware.[61]In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation[62]and breast cancer detection in mammograms.[63]LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN byYann LeCunet al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks  digitized in 32x32 pixel images.[64]
Recurrent neural networks(RNN)[28][30]were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were theJordan network(1986)[65]and theElman network(1990),[66]which applied RNN to study problems incognitive psychology.
In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991,JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuberproposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time byself-supervised learningwhere each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below.[67][68]This ""neural history compressor"" usespredictive codingto learninternal representationsat multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can becollapsedinto a single RNN, bydistillinga higher levelchunkernetwork into a lower levelautomatizernetwork.[67][68][31]In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a ""Very Deep Learning"" task that required more than 1000 subsequentlayersin an RNN unfolded in time.[69]The ""P"" inChatGPTrefers to such pre-training.
Sepp Hochreiter's diploma thesis (1991)[70]implemented the neural history compressor,[67]and identified and analyzed thevanishing gradient problem.[70][71]Hochreiter proposed recurrentresidualconnections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to thelong short-term memory(LSTM), published in 1995.[72]LSTM can learn ""very deep learning"" tasks[9]with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a ""forget gate"", introduced in 1999,[73]which became the standard RNN architecture.
In 1991,JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuberalso published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of azero-sum game, where one network's gain is the other network's loss.[74][75]The first network is agenerative modelthat models aprobability distributionover output patterns. The second network learns bygradient descentto predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called ""artificial curiosity"". In 2014, this principle was used ingenerative adversarial networks(GANs).[76]
During 1985â€“1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed byTerry Sejnowski,Peter Dayan,Geoffrey Hinton, etc., including theBoltzmann machine,[77]restricted Boltzmann machine,[78]Helmholtz machine,[79]and thewake-sleep algorithm.[80]These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p.Â 112[81]). A 1988 network became state of the art inprotein structure prediction, an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics.[82]
Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs forspeech recognitionhave been explored for many years.[83][84][85]These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussianmixture model/Hidden Markov model(GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively.[86]Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing[70]and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models.[87][88]Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power.
Mostspeech recognitionresearchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was atSRI Internationalin the late 1990s. Funded by the US government'sNSAandDARPA, SRI researched in speech andspeaker recognition. The speaker recognition team led byLarry Heckreported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998NISTSpeaker Recognition benchmark.[89][90]It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning.[91]
The principle of elevating ""raw"" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the ""raw"" spectrogram or linearfilter-bankfeatures in the late 1990s,[90]showing its superiority over theMel-Cepstralfeatures that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech,waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.[92]
Neural networks entered a lull, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such asGabor filtersandsupport vector machines(SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.[citation needed]
In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.[93]In 2006,Alex Graves, Santiago FernÃ¡ndez, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it withconnectionist temporal classification(CTC)[94]in stacks of LSTMs.[95]In 2009, it became the first RNN to win apattern recognitioncontest, in connectedhandwriting recognition.[96][9]
In 2006, publications byGeoff Hinton,Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero andTeh[97][98]deep belief networkswere developed for generative modeling. They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionallyfine-tunedusing supervised backpropagation.[99]They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution ofMNIST images, but convergence was slow.[100][101][102]
The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun.[103]Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.
The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.[104]The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different,[105]offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems.[23][106][107]Analysis around 2009â€“2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition.[105]That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.[104][105][108]In 2010, researchers extended deep learning fromTIMITto large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed bydecision trees.[109][110][111][106]
The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision.
Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years,[112]including CNNs,[113]faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning.[114]
A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU. Some early work dated back to 2004.[112][113]In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, andAndrew Ngreported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 NvidiaGeForce GTX 280GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning. They reported up to 70 times faster training.[115]
In 2011, a CNN namedDanNet[116][117]by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci,Luca Maria Gambardella, andJÃ¼rgen Schmidhuberachieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3.[9]It then won more contests.[118][119]They also showed howmax-poolingCNNs on GPU improved performance significantly.[3]
In 2012,Andrew NgandJeff Deancreated an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken fromYouTubevideos.[120]
In October 2012,AlexNetbyAlex Krizhevsky,Ilya Sutskever, andGeoffrey Hinton[4]won the large-scaleImageNet competitionby a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included theVGG-16network byKaren SimonyanandAndrew Zisserman[121]and Google'sInceptionv3.[122]
The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task ofgenerating descriptions(captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.[123][124][125]
In 2014, the state of the art was training ""very deep neural network"" with 20 to 30 layers.[126]Stacking too many layers led to a steep reduction intrainingaccuracy,[127]known as the ""degradation"" problem.[128]In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and theresidual neural network(ResNet)[129]in Dec 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net.
Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art. Early examples includedGoogle DeepDream(2015), andneural style transfer(2015),[130]both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such asVGG-19.
Generative adversarial network(GAN) by (Ian Goodfellowet al., 2014)[131](based onJÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's principle of artificial curiosity[74][76])
became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period. Excellent image quality is achieved byNvidia'sStyleGAN(2018)[132]based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al.[133]Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerningdeepfakes.[134]Diffusion models(2015)[135]eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such asDALLÂ·E 2(2022) andStable Diffusion(2022).
In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available throughGoogle Voice Searchonsmartphone.[136][137]
Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision andautomatic speech recognition(ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such asTIMIT(ASR) andMNIST(image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved.[104][138]Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR byLSTM.[137][139][140][141]but are more successful in computer vision.
Yoshua Bengio,Geoffrey HintonandYann LeCunwere awarded the 2018Turing Awardfor ""conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing"".[142]"
