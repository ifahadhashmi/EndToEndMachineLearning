Deep learning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning,"Inmachine learning,deep learningfocuses on utilizing multilayeredneural networksto perform tasks such asclassification,regression, andrepresentation learning. The field takes inspiration frombiological neuroscienceand is centered around stackingartificial neuronsinto layers and ""training"" them to process data. The adjective ""deep"" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can besupervised,semi-supervisedorunsupervised.[2]"
